CHIPS.EXE
====
This is a disassembly of Chip's Challenge for Windows 95.

It builds the following executable:

* CHIPS.EXE `sha256: 8e26acd67cf120bd5b512de4b4e78b80aca1579413cd04f3b2b68909a375866c`


Progress
----
All of the code has been disassembled.

The core game logic has been extensively commented; see `logic.asm` and `movement.asm`.
Almost all of the game's memory has been mapped out; see `data.asm` and `structs.asm`.
If you are interested in the address of a particular variable, check out `variables.asm`.

The rest of the code has been disassembled but may lack useful function/data labels and comments.

Dependencies
----
To build, you'll need the following programs installed:

* make
* nasm
* awk
* golang

Go is required for building the linker and (optionally) some other tools.

Some tools require python3, but they aren't used in the build.

Building
----

1. (optional) Copy the game executable to `base.exe` in this directory

2. Run `make`

3. (optional) Run `make check` to compare the output with the base image.
